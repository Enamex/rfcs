# Summary
[summary]: #summary

We propose a simple, yet sufficiently expressive, addition of dependent-types
(also known as, Œ†-types and value-types).

Type checking will not require SMT-solvers or other forms of theorem provers.

## Generic value parameters

A `const` type parameter acts like a generic parameter, containing a constant
expression. Declaring a generic parameter `a: const usize`, creates a constant
variable `a` of type `usize`.

One can create implementations, structs, enums, and traits, abstracting over
this generic value parameter.

We use the syntax `a: const value` to denote the constant type parameter, `a`,
of constant value, `value`.  This can be used at both type-level (as parameter)
and value-level (as expression).

## Compile time calculations on constant parameters

Since it is simply consisting of constexprs, one can apply constant functions
(`const fn`) to the parameter, to perform compile time, type level calculations
on the parameter. This allows for great expressiveness as `const fn` improves.

## Expression `where` bounds

The second construct added is the constant expression in `where` bounds. These
contains statements about the constant parameters, which are checked at compile
time.

## Type checking

Type checking is done lazily by evaluating the bounds and constexprs.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

An often requested feature is the "type-level numerals", which enables generic
length arrays. The current proposals are often limited to integers or even lack
of value maps, and other critical features.

There is a whole lot of other usecases as well. These allows certain often
requested features to live in standalone libraries (e.g., bounded-integers,
type level arithmetics, lattice types).

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

## The new value-type construct, `const`

The first construct, we will introduce is `Œµ ‚Üí œÑ` constructor, `const`. All this
does is taking a const-expr (struct construction, arithmetic expression, and so
on) and constructs a _type-level version_ of this.

In particular, we extend the type grammar with an additional `const C`, a type
whose semantics can be described as follows,

    ValueTypeRepresentation:
      Œ† ‚ä¢ x: const c
      --------------
      Œ† ‚ä¢ x = c

In other words, if `x` has type `const c`, its value _is_ `c`. That is, any
constexpr, `c`, will either be of its underlying type or of the type, `const
c`.

It is important to understand that values of `const c` are constexprs, and
follows their rules.

## `const fn`s as Œ†-constructors

We are interested in value dependency, but at the same time, we want to avoid
complications such as SMT-solvers and so on.

Thus, we follow a purely constructible model, by using `const fn`s.

Let `f` be a `const fn` function. From the rules of `const fn`s and constexprs,
we can derive the rule,

    PiConstructorInference:
      Œ† ‚ä¢ x: const c
      Œ† ‚ä¢ f(c): œÑ
      -----------------
      Œ† ‚ä¢ f(x): const œÑ

This allows one to take some const parameter and map it by some arbitrary, pure
function.

## Type inference

Since we are able to evaluate the function at compile time, we can easily infer
const types, by adding an unification relation, from the rule above.

The relational edge between two const types is simple a const fn, which is
resolved under unification.

We add an extra rule to improve inference:

    PiDependencyInference:
      Œì ‚ä¢ T: A ‚Üí ùì§
      Œì ‚ä¢ a: T<c>
      Œì ‚ä¢ a: T<x>
      --------------
      Œì ‚ä¢ x: const c

This allows us infer:

```rust
// [T; N] is a constructor, T ‚Üí usize ‚Üí ùì§ (parameterize over T and you get A ‚Üí ùì§).
fn foo<n: const usize, l: const [u32; n]>() -> [u32; n] {
    // ^ note how l depends on n.
    l
}

// We know n from the length of the array.
let l = baz::<_, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]>();
//            ^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

## `where` clauses

Often, it is wanted to have some statically checked clause satisfied by the
constant parameters. To archive this, in a reasonable manner, we use const
exprs, returning a boolean.

We allow such constexprs in `where` clauses of functions. Whenever the
function is invoked given constant parameters `<a, b...>`, the compiler
evaluates this expression, and if it returns `false`, an aborting error is
invoked.

To sum up, the check happens at monomorphization, thus a function can type
check until it is called (note that this is already possible in present day
Rust, through `where` bounds).

## The type grammar

These extensions expand the type grammar to:

         T = scalar (i32, u32, ...)        // Scalars
           | X                             // Type variable
           | Id<P0..Pn>                    // Nominal type (struct, enum)
           | &r T                          // Reference (mut doesn't matter here)
           | O0..On+r                      // Object type
           | [T]                           // Slice type
           | for<r..> fn(T1..Tn) -> T0     // Function pointer
           | <P0 as Trait<P1..Pn>>::Id     // Projection
    +      | C                             // const types
    +    F = c                             // const fn name
    +    C = E                             // Pi constructed const type
         P = r                             // Region name
           | T                             // Type
         O = for<r..> TraitId<P1..Pn>      // Object type fragment
         r = 'x                            // Region name
    +    E = F(E)                          // Constant function application.
    +      | p                             // const type parameter
    +      | [...]                         // etc.

Note that the `const` prefix is only used when declaring the parameter.

## `impl` unification

Only one `where` bound can be specified on each disjoint implementations (for
possible extensions, see below).

To find the right implementation, we use the data from the type inference (see
the inference rules above). Since the parameters are, in fact, not much
semantically different from normal generic parameters, we can resolve it is a
normal manner.

Likewise are disjointness checks based on structural equality.

Since not all parameters' edges are necessarily the identity function,
dispatching these would be undecidable. A way to solve this problem is to
introduce some syntax allowing to specify the `impl` parameters.

## An example

This is the proposed syntax:

```rust
use std::{mem, ptr};

// We start by declaring a struct which is value dependent.
struct Array<n: const usize, T> {
    // `n` is a constexpr, sharing similar behavior with `const`s, thus this
    // is possible.
    content: [T; n],
}

// We are interested in exploring the `where` clauses and Œ†-constructors:
impl<n: const usize, T> Array<n, T> {
    // This is simple statically checked indexing.
    fn const_index<i: const usize>(&self) -> &T where i < n {
    //                   note that this is constexpr  ^^^^^
        unsafe { self.content.unchecked_index(i) }
    }

    // "Push" a new element, incrementing its length **statically**.
    fn push(self, elem: T) -> Array<n + 1, T> {
        let mut new: [T; n + 1] = mem::uninitialized();
        //               ^^^^^ constexpr
        unsafe {
            ptr::copy(self.content.as_ptr(), new.as_mut_ptr(), n);
            ptr::write(new.as_mut_ptr().offset(n), elem);
        }

        // Don't call destructors.
        mem::forget(self.content);

        // So, the compiler knows the type of `new`. Thus, it can easily check
        // if the return type is matching. By siply evaluation `n + 1`, then
        // comparing against the given return type.
        Array { content: new }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let array: Array<2, u32> = Array { content: [1, 2] };

    assert_eq!(array.const_index::<0>(), 1);
    assert_eq!(array.const_index::<1>(), 2);
    assert_eq!(array.push(3).const_index::<2>(), 3);
}
```

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

If we want to have type-level Turing completeness, the halting problem is
inevitable. One could "fix" this by adding timeouts, like the current recursion
bounds.

Another draw back is the lack of implication proves.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

Use full SMT-based dependent types. These are more expressive, but severely
more complex as well.

## Alternative syntax

The syntax is described above is, in fact, ambiguous, and multiple other better or worse
candidates exists:

### Blending the value parameters into the arguments

This one is an interesting one. It allows for defining functions with constant
_arguments_ instead of constant _parameters_. This allows for bounds on e.g.
`atomic::Ordering`.

```rust
fn do_something(const x: u32) -> u32 where x < 5 { x }
```

### Square brackets

Use square brackets for dependent parameters:

```rust
fn do_something[x: u32]() -> u32 where x < 5 { x }

do_something::[2]();
```

### `const` _before_ the parameter

Use the proposed syntax in similar manner to constant definitions:

```rust
fn do_something<const x: u32>() -> u32 where x < 5 { x }

do_something::<2>();
```

### Allow multiple implementation bounds

Allow overlapping implementations carrying bounds, such that only one of the
conditions may be true under monomorphization.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

What syntax is preferred? How does this play together with HKP? Can we improve
the converse type inference? What should be the naming conventions? Should we
segregate the value parameters and type parameters by `;`? Disjoint
implementations satisfying some bound?
